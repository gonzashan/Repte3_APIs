# Repte3_APIs

What we need to develop is a small API that allows them to execute various actions, specifically the login view and the singup view.


## Objectives to be implemented (User stories):

- API must be available at the port: 3001

- Login path (has username and password as parameters)

- Sign-up path (has the parameters that can be seen in the Register page view of the figma (seen at the start of the challenge).

- The signup path must save users in a json file and encrypt the password so as not to save sensitive data.

- When saving a new user, check that neither the email nor the username is repeated.

- You need to check that the email is in the correct format.

- When creating them you need to save the creation date.
